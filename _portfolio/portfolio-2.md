title: "Resilient Airspace Operations "
excerpt: "The seamless functioning of air travel heavily relies on enhanced air traffic management.  At the heart of this system lies the Terminal Manoeuvring Area (TMA) â€“-- a controlled airspace that handles a high volume of traffic, spanning approximately 100 to 200 nautical miles around the airport vicinity. This confined yet crucial airspace is where incoming and outgoing aircraft converge and diverge, making meticulous planning and execution of utmost importance to ensure smooth and safe operations. In this research, we propose an integrated optimization approach that utilizes matheuristic algorithms to optimize runway aircraft sequencing decisions in the TMA, including aircraft speeds, utilization of holding stacks, vectoring and point-merger implementation. Our proposed algorithm employs an iterative process that combines a Linear Programming (LP) model with a Genetic Algorithm, enabling the rapid generation of feasible solutions (within 5 second) and convergence to near-optimal solutions in approximately 5 minutes (for time-windows of 3 hours). <img src="/images/TMAProject.png" width="48">
