title: "Resilient Airspace Operations "
excerpt: "Airport congestion poses a substantial challenge, leading to costly delays and negative environmental impacts. In response, airports employ slot allocation mechanisms to manage scheduled air traffic. This involves two key strategies: (i) setting declared capacity limits to govern the volume of flights at the airport and (ii) optimizing flight schedules through slot allocation. This project is dedicated to devising analytical methods that integrate optimization techniques, machine learning, and queueing models. The goal is to support airport managers and slot coordinators in establishing efficient declared capacity limits and optimizing slot allocation decisions. This approach aims to yield benefits across the board, positively impacting airports, airlines, and passengers by mitigating delays and enhancing overall operational efficiency. <br/><img src='/images/SlotAllocationProject.png'>"
