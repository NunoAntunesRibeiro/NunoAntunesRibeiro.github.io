title: "Airport Slot Allocation and Capacity Declaration"
excerpt: "Airport congestion presents a significant challenge, leading to costly delays and adverse environmental effects. To tackle this issue, airports utilize slot allocation mechanisms to manage scheduled air traffic. This involves two main approaches: (i) setting declared capacity limits to govern the volume of flights at the airport and (ii) optimizing flight schedules through slot allocation. The objective of this project is to develop advanced analytical methods grounded in optimization, queuing models, and machine learning. These methods seek to assist airport managers and slot coordinators in establishing efficient declared capacity limits and optimizing slot allocation decisions for more favorable times, ultimately benefiting airports, airlines, and passengers. 1<br/><img src='/images/SlotAllocationProject.png'>"
