<h3>40.015 Course Description</h3>

Real-world optimisation problems are often nonlinear, multimodal and with various complex constraints. Traditional exact optimisation methods frequently fail to accurately obtain solutions for these problems in reasonable computation times. Metaheuristic optimisation methods are artificial intelligence search methods used in the design and management of a wide range of complex systems. The aim of these methods is not so much finding the optimal solution for a given problem, but to solve rapidly large and realistic instances while ensuring good quality of the solutions. Metaheuristics are commonly used in many research applications and industries, such as supply chain, logistics, transportation, aviation, urban planning, energy, water resources, robotics, etc. This course describes a variety of metaheuristic search methods including, simulated annealing, tabu search, ant colony, particle swarm, genetic algorithms, and multi-objective metaheuristics. Real case studies are presented to emphasize the solution process and performance analysis of the various metaheuristic methods.
