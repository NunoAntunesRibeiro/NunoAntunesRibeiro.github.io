<h3>40.015 Course Description</h3>

The objective of Simulation Modelling and Analysis (SMA) course is to train students identify complex engineering systems which could be analysed using simulation models, get a taste of various simulation methodologies, build models and critically evaluate competing design alternatives using appropriate statistical techniques.

<h3>Topics Covered</h3>

Part I: Modeling paradigms and techniques 
- System Dynamics models: SEIR models, Urban Dynamics models, Software environment: [InsightMaker](https://insightmaker.com/) and Excel
- Agent-based modeling, simulation, Software environment: HTML5 + JavaScript + D3
- Discrete event simulation: Modeling via Event graphs, programming, managing event queues, Software environment: Excel + VBA + Jackson Event Graph
- Process simulation: Using discrete event simulation packages with drag-and-drop interface, Software environment: [JaamSim](https://jaamsim.com/) and [Simio](https://www.simio.com/)

Part II: Monte Carlo simulation, handling uncertainty in simulation input and output variables
- Monte Carlo method for computing expectations
- Statistical analysis of uncertain simulation output: Eliminating initialization bias in steady-state simulations, Construction of interval estimates in terminating and steady-state simulations, comparing alternative system configurations
- Generation of input variables for simulation: Writing code to obtain samples of discrete and continuous random variables, pseudorandom number generation, generation of arrival processes
- Variance reduction techniques: Using common random numbers, antithetic variables and control variates

<h3>Projects</h3>

The SMA project takes the students through a wholesome journey beginning from choosing a real-world system for their study. They then work intensely in teams collecting data, building a suitable simulation model, offering critical comparison with competing design alternatives, etc. based on the needs of their project. A flexible grading scheme, which recognises different project choices may entail different efforts in the above steps, empower students to give a real go at the problem of their choice without having worry about grades.
