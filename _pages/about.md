Biography
======
Nuno Ribeiro is an Assistant Professor with the Engineering Systems and Design Pillar at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) teaching courses on 40.321 Airport Systems Modeling and Simulation, 40.015 Simulation Modeling and Analysis;  40.614 Metaheuristic Optimization; and 01.400 Capstone

Nuno Ribeiro has received his Ph.D. in Transport Systems from the University of Coimbra (Portugal). During his stints as a Ph.D. student, Nuno also held visiting research positions in MIT and Carnegie Mellon University. In his research, he develops and apply operations research methods (such as optimization, machine learning and simulation) to support the decision-making process in transportation system management. In his PhD dissertation, Nuno has developed a novel decision-making tool for airport schedule coordination. The tool is aimed to support airport slot coordinators to perform demand management interventions at congested airports in a way that reduces imbalances between demand and capacity, while promoting attractive schedules of flights for the airlines and passengers. Nuno’s work has received attention from academia and industry stakeholders reflected in several research awards, such as the Anna Valicek Medal by the AGIFORS in 2018, best the PhD dissertation by INFORMS-AAS in 2019 and the best paper award by INFORMS-AAS in 2020.

Nuno Ribeiro is a principal investigator in the Aviation Studies Institute in SUTD. He is currently working on 3 funded research projects in collaboration with CAAS on “Airfield Management and Economics” ; “Resilient Airspace Operations for Changi Airport” ; “Rapid Evaluation Tools Within the Intelligent Optimisation Platform”.
