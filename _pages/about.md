<h3>About Me</h3>

I currently hold the position of Assistant Professor within the [Engineering Systems and Design Pillar](https://esd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/nuno-ribeiro/) (ESD) at [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD). Additionally, I serve as a Principal Investigator at the [Aviation Studies Institute](https://asi.sutd.edu.sg/) in SUTD, where I am engaged in diverse research projects in collaboration with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (for more details, please refer to my [Portfolio](https://nunoantunesribeiro.github.io/portfolio/)).

Before joining SUTD, I pursued my doctoral studies in Transport Systems at the University of Coimbra in Portugal. During this period, I also undertook visiting research appointments at renowned institutions such as MIT and Carnegie Mellon University.

My research primarily focuses on the application of operations research methodologies to enhance decision-making processes within transportation system management. I employ a range of techniques including mathematical programming, metaheuristics, simulation modeling, machine learning, and econometrics. Of particular interest to me is the integration of optimization methods with machine learning techniques. My research addresses various aspects of air transportation, with a specific emphasis on airport slot allocation and capacity declaration, passenger connectivity, air traffic management, resilient airspace operations, and the impact of convective weather on air traffic.
